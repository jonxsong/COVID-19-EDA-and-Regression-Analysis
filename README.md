COVID 19 is an ongoing threat.  Data for the outbreak are available here: 

https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide (Links to an external site.)

1)Descriptive Statistics: Do an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and provide appropriate summary statistics / visualizations to help understand the spread of the disease (incidence) as well as its fatality rate. 

2)Inferential Statistics: Pick 2 countries and compare their incidence and fatality rates using hypothesis testing and confidence interval methods

3)Correlation: Pick all the countries and evaluate the relationship between incidence rates and fatality rates. Compute the correlation coefficient, if relevant.

4)Regression: Pick United States. Look at the time series of cases and time series of deaths. Use a regression model to predict the number of cases and the number of deaths for the next 5 days in the future.
